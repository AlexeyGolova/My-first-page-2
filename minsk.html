      <p class="lead my-4">I acquired this dream not so long ago. In fact, I have always wanted to move to some other city with my wife, since we are very tired of our native one, and unpleasant familiar faces are already at every step, so in the future we plan to move.  After our trip to the capital of Belarus - Minsk, we were impressed by the diversity and beauty of this city. We had only positive emotions from this trip. We visited a lot of different places.  And they left everyone with positive emotions. As we arrived, we left the train station and went in a random direction. We saw a lot of beautiful things, then turned onto a rather beautiful and creative street, where the walls of buildings were painted in various interesting drawings, it was not lively at that time of day, but we liked it. Then we went to the mall, first had breakfast there, and then went shopping.  After that we went for a walk in the old town, where it was very beautiful. A little later we went to the park, where there were more attractions. After riding them, we went to lunch with good impressions and emotions. After lunch, we also went for a walk around the city, visited many beautiful places, visited various parks. Some time later we came to a very beautiful residential area, we liked it so much that we wanted to live in it in the future. However, housing is expensive. But we gave ourselves a goal so that it would not become a reality to make our dream come true and achieve our own.  After visiting this area, we went to the same street that we visited at the very beginning of our arrival. It turned out to be very lively there in the evening. There was live music playing and an unrealistically cool atmosphere reigned. It was probably one of the most memorable places. Having had a delicious dinner there, we went to the train station, got into the car, fell asleep on one bed, and in the morning we were already in our hometown. In general, having been impressed by this city, we created a dream for ourselves to move there in the future, and build our family there already, and achieve this dream with great joint work, I am sure we will succeed!</p>
