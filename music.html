          <p class="lead my-4">Music is an art form. According to A. N. Sokhor (ME 3, 1976), this species "reflects reality and affects a person through meaningful and specially organized sound sequences in height and time, consisting mainly of tones." In BRE (2013), music is defined as "the art of sounds organized mainly by pitch and time." Eggebrecht, speaking of music "in the Western sense of the word," defines it as "an artistic organization of sound, which, in the sense of a natural and emotionally perceived sounding phenomenon, paints a picture of the world and soul, unconsciously and concretely grasped by the ear, and in the sense of art [this sound] becomes the spiritual "language" of the material world, reflected and ordered (and therefore meaningful and meaningful) thanks to theoretical knowledge." There are other encyclopedic definitions of music. In the early stages of human development, music was almost exclusively applied. Hence the "canonicity" of the musical style, the small expression of the individual author's principle in it. In the professional creativity of mature musical cultures, music was gradually freed from direct dependence on the word, dance, ritual context. Beginning in the late Middle Ages (XV century), and especially in the Renaissance, forms of so-called autonomous music developed in Europe for the first time (according to G. Besseler "presented", that is, intended exclusively for listening), an independent logic of compositional thinking has developed, the composer's profession itself has become isolated. In Modern times (since the Baroque era), the "applied" component continued to exist in the form of so-called program music, but in parallel ideas of the "immanent essence" of music arose, one of the most popular in the XIX century — the idea of absolute music. In the works of the avant—gardists of the XX century, the "autonomous" vector of music history reached another culmination - composers gave their compositions titles that excluded any associations with familiar genres and forms (for example, Webern's "Five Pieces for Orchestra", Boulez's "Structures", Ustvolskaya's "Composition No. 2", etc.), or attributed the headings of the essays were purely conditional.
