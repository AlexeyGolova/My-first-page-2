      <p class="lead my-4">Since I was a teenager, I was brought up on the genre of rock music. I liked it so much that soon I continued my guitar training and played my favorite rock songs. Even at these moments, I had my first thoughts about creating my own rock band, but due to lack of experience, this remained only thoughts. As time went on, I continued my musical development, and soon I learned to play the piano, continuing to listen exclusively to the rock genre. And in these times, thoughts about your group have already become not just thoughts, but whole dreams. Soon my first attempts to create my own band appeared, my friend and I decided to compose our own songs for fun, he sang, and I played, although I didn't like the way he sings at all, and I always wanted to be on vocals, because I did it much better, and had my own chips, but still I was getting high from it, because part of my dream had come true. Inspired by the support of friends, we posted videos on Instagram where we play our songs, we did. This group was called "Children of the Sunset", but soon it ceased to exist, because my friend stopped wanting to make songs, he said he was tired of doing them and did them just for fun. Disappointed, I continued to develop creatively. I reached the professional level of playing guitar, I could do what 95% of other guitarists simply could not, I also mastered the piano well enough. I really liked making music myself, I wrote my own songs, mostly they are all very sad, but I still really liked doing it. Soon I wrote songs under 50, but I realized that it would not sound very good in one instrument, but I still continued to write and record my songs on a dictaphone, occasionally sharing these recordings with friends. A little later I moved to another educational institution, where I made many new acquaintances, including musicians. One day I brought two of my classmates home and played my songs to them, according to them, they really liked it. And one of them recorded my performance of my songs on his phone and posted it to his Instagram stories. His stories were watched, and one musician from my school wrote to him that he wanted to meet me. The next day, my classmate introduced me to this man. He had other musician friends, and he suggested that I create a band where I would sing and play guitar, as I always wanted. I was very inspired by all this, because I became a few steps closer to my dream. But soon all my dreams were shattered into reality. These musicians turned out to be very bad, they played like I played in the first grade of music school, in general, terribly. Pulling them along, I just got tired of their mediocrity. In the end, we had a big fight. Because of me. We quarreled because we didn't match each other's skill. I said that I play great, and they're all mediocre. They hated me. Left alone, I continued to pursue my creative activities.At the moment I have already written more than a hundred songs. And I hope that someday I will find people with the same thoughts and goals in terms of music as me. Believe and achieve your goals!</p>
