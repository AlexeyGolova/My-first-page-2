          <p class="lead my-4">Gym — a specially equipped room, including equipment, and intended for training, sports games, sports or physical education.

            Gym are arranged in almost all secondary and higher educational institutions around the world. They are equipped with both stationary and collapsible sports equipment, which allows them to be transformed into a volleyball or basketball court.They first appeared in Europe, Russia and the United States in the XIX century. In Germany, one of the first halls opened in 1852, overseas at about the same time, the first venues were built in Cincinnati, St. Louis and New York. As a rule, they were built by sports organizations. With the popularization of physical education, educational institutions also joined them. Their appearance was caused by the fact that for a significant part of the year climatic conditions are not favorable in many countries for outdoor sports, while indoor sports can be done regardless of the vagaries of the weather.

            In the XX century, specialized gyms are equipped with various fitness equipment for bodybuilding (their convenience is in the targeted impact on muscle groups and individual muscles), which are installed permanently; as a rule, they are smaller in area than traditional playgrounds.
            
            
            Gym for bodybuilding, Hollywood.
            In the second half of the XX century, there was a tendency to saturate gyms with exercise equipment simulating running (treadmill), cycling, skiing. Gyms become unsuitable for collective sports games due to their size and saturation with sports equipment, but they are organized closer to the place of residence of those involved and are open in most cases almost seven days a week.
