          <p class="lead my-4">A video game is a game using images generated by electronic equipment. In other words, a video game is an electronic game (English) Russian, which is based on the interaction of a person and a device through a visual interface, such as a TV, computer monitor or phone.

            Other definitions of the term:
            
            a computer game played on a TV screen using a game console.
            a video game device (the subject of which is a video game) is a household electronic device designed to display game information on the screen of a television receiver or a household video monitor.
            At the same time, currently the terms computer game and video game can be used synonymously and interchangeably.The first video games used many electronic devices to communicate with the user. So, the first registered game that can be attributed to a video game is a Rocket simulator, the interface of which was an analog device based on a cathode ray tube (CRT) (the patent application was filed on January 25, 1947). The creation of this game was due to the invention of CRT, which made it possible to form an image on the screen. However, due to the fact that the Rocket Simulator did not have a bitmap type of image, which is typical for monitors and televisions, this device is more often mistaken for an electronic game (Eng.) rus., but is referred to as a video game. But at the same time, from a technical point of view, a Rocket simulator is a video game.

            Early examples of video games are OXO's first software game, the first created for Tennis for Two entertainment, Spacewar! as the first video game that was available outside of the organization that developed it. Defining a video game for games of this time has its difficulties, for example, these games were not created as interactive programs, and were not developed as games. At the same time, they were not popular and massive, as they were not replicated and did not go beyond the organizations where they were created. This was caused by a number of difficulties when computers of the 1960s occupied rooms, used radio tubes, which required cooling and constant maintenance. One of the revolutions in computer games was the transition to a transistor element base and the mass use of a teletype. Here, one of the consequences was the differentiation of games by the user interaction interface: video games and text games.
            
            Historically, video games appeared before the personal computer was created. This is due to the fact that in the 1960s computer technology was not widespread and was not considered as a serious tool in the civil sphere. Created video games on an electronic basis (electronic games) they played an important role in the peaceful socialization of computer technology and its integration into popular culture. In the 1970s, video games became one of the most popular entertainment when slot machines were installed in bars, cafes and other establishments.
