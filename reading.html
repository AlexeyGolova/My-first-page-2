        <p class="lead my-4">Reading is a set of practices and procedures for working with written text and the process of working with the text itself, aimed at extracting information from it, at perceiving the text and understanding it. In a broad sense, the process of extracting information also from any symbolic system (Braille characters, musical notation, and so on) is not limited to linking written signs with the corresponding sounds, it is a complex cognitive process in which higher mental functions are directly involved. The reading process includes both a phonetic process and a semantic one, that is, reading comprehension, while the translation of written speech into oral speech depends on the writing system, significantly differing for alphabetic, logographic and ideographic writing. Reading is one of the means of language acquisition, communication, exchange of information and ideas. It is a complex interaction between the text and the reader, formed on the basis of prior knowledge, experience and the reader's relationship with the linguistic community, conditioned culturally and socially. In addition, reading requires creativity and critical analysis. There are no laws in reading, nothing restricts the reader in reading. This helps to explore the texts during interpretation.Along with the appearance of writing as a form of fixation of meanings expressed in language, reading appeared as the reverse side of writing, as part of communication, separated from the situation of interaction "here-and-now". Initially, the main areas of application of reading were the sphere of economic activity (accounting and control), in which reading consolidated the system of power relations, the sphere of religion, where "sacred texts" assumed selective reading (at a special time, by special persons) as one of the main components in cult practices, and the sphere of literature, which assumed the reading of the text in different in ritualized spaces.[

          For the development of reading practices and procedures, the emergence of alphabet-based phonetic writing systems was of great importance, which made it possible to read the text without knowing and understanding the meanings of its constituent units, which made it possible to change the system of teaching reading and expand the circle of readers who have mastered at least elementary literacy.</p>
