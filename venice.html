      <p class="lead my-4"> Venice is a city in the northeast of Italy. The administrative center of the Venice region and the territorial unit of the same name, equated to the province. Forms a commune divided into 6 self-governing districts. The patron saint of the city is the Apostle Mark, the evangelist, whose relics are kept here in St. Mark's Cathedral, in connection with which many Christian pilgrims from all over the world have always come to the city.

        The population is 259,939 people (30-06-2019). It is located on the mainland (after the merger with the city of Mestre in 1926) and 118 islands of the Venetian Lagoon of the Adriatic Sea. It is subject to autumn floods from the surge wave from the sea.
        
        A major tourist and scientific and educational center. In the mainland there is a seaport and the Marco Polo International Airport, an oil refinery and other plants. The venue of the Venice Carnival and the Venice Film Festival.
        
        The architectural appearance of the city was formed during the heyday of the Republic of Venice in the XIV—XVI centuries. Together with the Venetian Lagoon, it is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
        
        In ancient times, the Veneti area was inhabited by Veneti (hence the name of the city). An island city from the IX century. In the Middle Ages, it was the center of the Venetian Republic with numerous colonies in the Mediterranean Sea. The growth of the Ottoman Empire led to the decline of Venice in the XVII—XVIII centuries; during the Napoleonic Wars, it fell under the rule of Austria. In 1866 it became part of Italy. The name of the city comes from the region of Venetia, and that is from the tribe of Veneti, who lived here in Roman times. However, there was no urban settlement in the lagoon under the Romans. People began to settle in the Venetian Lagoon after the invasions of the barbarians — the Visigoths, the Huns of Attila and the Lombards — who passed here in the V—VI centuries and devastated cities on the continent, the most significant of which was Aquileia. The urban settlement on the islands of the Venetian Lagoon began to be created in the second half of the VI century[4]. Initially, the center of the settlement was located on the islands of Malamocco and Torcello, but since the VIII century it began to move to its modern position. In the VII century, the islands, at the initiative of Byzantium, to which they formally belonged, were united under the rule of a single ruler — the doge. The first doge, Paolo Lucio Anafesto, was elected in 697, for which there is no documentary evidence, and replaced the Byzantine Magister militum, who ruled the entire province. Since the middle of the eighth century, the doge was elected in Venice; he did not have to be approved by the Byzantine emperor. The first election of a doge confirmed by sources took place in 727; a total of 120 doges were elected in the entire history of the city. The latter, Ludovico Manin, abdicated in 1797.
        
        After the occupation of Ravenna by the Lombards, Venice remained the last territory in Italy that was formally under the control of Byzantium. After the inclusion of the rest of Italy into the empire of Charlemagne, it actually remained a link connecting Byzantium and the Western world, which contributed to the rapid growth of Venice as a trading city. In the IX century, this growth was restrained by the danger of invasion by Hungarians, Slavs or Arabs (in 975, the Muslim fleet reached the city of Grado). During the reign of Doge Pietro II Orseolo (991-1009) Venice managed to conclude treaties with all the surrounding powers, ensuring the independence of the city and unhindered trade, as well as to begin the territorial expansion of the republic by seizing territories in Dalmatia.
        
        In 828, the relics of St. Mark, stolen in Alexandria, were transferred to Venice and placed in a specially built cathedral for this purpose. By the end of the IX century, Venice acquired the structure, with islands and canals, which it retains to this day. To protect against a possible Hungarian invasion, a defensive system was built with walls and a chain blocking the entrance to the Grand Canal.
        
        Since the founding of the city in Venice, there has never been a vassal relationship between the citizens of the republic. In this sense, it was a unique state education in medieval Europe. When Doge Pietro IV Candiano tried to pursue a policy of greater involvement of Venice in Italian affairs, the fear of the gradual introduction of vassalage caused the uprising of 976, as a result of which the doge was killed. Around 1040, a statute was passed forbidding anyone during the doge's lifetime to appoint a co-ruler or successor to him.</p>
