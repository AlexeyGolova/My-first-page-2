          <p class="lead my-4">Programming is the process of creating computer programs.

            In the words of one of the founders of programming languages Niklaus Wirth "Programs = algorithms + data structures".
            
            Programming is based on the use of programming languages in which the source texts of programs are written. 205 BC (150 BC) — the Antikythera mechanism from ancient Greece was a calculator that used gears of various sizes and configurations that determine its operation to track the Metonic cycle, still used in lunar-solar calendars.
            
            1206 — Al-Jazari built a programmable humanoid automaton. One system involved in these devices used clamps and cams placed in a wooden box in certain places, which sequentially engaged levers, which in turn controlled percussion instruments.
            
            1804 — the jacquard loom was built, built by Joseph Marie Jacquard, who revolutionized the weaving industry by making it possible to program patterns on fabrics using punched cards, it is sometimes considered the first programmable device.
            
            July 19, 1843 — Charles Babbage developed (but could not build it) the "Analytical Engine" — the first programmable computing device.
            
            July 19, 1843 — Countess Ada Augusta Lovelace, daughter of the English poet George Byron, wrote the first program in the history of mankind for an Analytical engine. This program solved the Bernoulli equation expressing the law of conservation of energy of a moving fluid. In her first and only scientific work, Ada Lovelace considered a large number of issues. A number of general propositions expressed by her (the principle of saving working memory cells, the connection of recurrent formulas with cyclic computing processes) have retained their fundamental importance for modern programming.
            
            Babbage's materials and Lovelace's comments outline such concepts as — a subroutine and a library of subroutines, modification of commands and an index register, which began to be used only in the 1950s. However, none of the programs written by Ada Lovelace has ever been launched].
            
            The first widely known and successful high-level programming language was Fortran, developed from 1954 to 1957 by a team of IBM researchers led by John Backus. The success of Fortran led to the formation of a committee of scientists to develop a "universal" computer language. Separately, John McCarthy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed the Lisp programming language (based on Lambda calculus), the first language that emerged in academic circles and gained success. With the success of these initial efforts, programming languages became an active research topic in the 1960s and beyond.

            <p>MFor a long time it was a mystery to me how something very expensive and technologically advanced could be so useless. And soon I realized that a computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, whereas programmers are smart people who have the talent to do incredible stupid things. In short, they found each other.</p>
