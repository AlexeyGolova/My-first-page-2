      <p class="lead my-4">Paris is the capital and largest city in France. It is located in the north of the state, in the central part of the Paris basin, on the river Seine. The population is 2.2 million people (2016). The center of the Greater Paris agglomeration (6.6 million), which is the core of the historic Ile-de-France region (more than 12 million). It forms a commune and a department divided into 20 arrondissements.

        Refers to global cities and global financial centers. The headquarters of UNESCO and other international organizations are located here.
        
        The historical center formed by the island of Cité and both banks of the Seine has been developing over the centuries. In the second half of the XIX century it underwent a radical reconstruction. The palace and park ensemble of Versailles is located in the suburb.
        
        It was founded in the III century BC by the Celtic tribe of the Parisians. Since the III—IV centuries it has been known as the Gallo-Roman city of Paris. Since the end of the X century, it has been the capital of France intermittently.Paris grew up on the site of the settlement of Lutetia, founded by the Celtic tribe of Parisians in the III century BC. The settlement was located on the safe island of Cité, surrounded by the waters of the River Seine. At the beginning of the II century BC, the settlement was surrounded by a fortress wall. The basis of the economy was trade: the Seine connected the Mediterranean Sea with the British Isles. In 52 BC . The Parisians joined the Gauls' revolt against the rule of Rome under the leadership of the Arvernian leader Vercingetorix. In the same year, the Battle of Lutetia took place, in which the Romans won. The writings of Julius Caesar "Notes on the Gallic War" belong to this time, in which Lutetia was first mentioned — "the city of Parisii, located on one of the islands of the Seine". After the Roman commander Titus Labienus besieged it, the inhabitants destroyed the bridges and burned the city.
        
        The Romans rebuilt it, building roads, villas, a 16-kilometer aqueduct, three baths, an amphitheater and a forum with a basilica out of stone. The Roman administration was located on the island of Sita, where the port continued to function. In the III century, the city was raided by the Germanic tribe of the Alemanni, which led to the relocation of residents from the left bank of the Seine to the more protected island of Cité. At the same time, Lutetia became known as the City of Parisii (Latin Civitas Parisiorum), and then Parisium (Latin Parisium). In the IV century, the first Christian church appeared. The fifth century saw the activity of Saint Genevieve, who became the patroness of Paris. In 470, the Salic Franks led by Hilderic I besieged the city for more than 10 years. At the end of the fifth century, Clovis temporarily turned Paris into the capital of the Frankish state.</p>
